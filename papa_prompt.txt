ENHANCEMENT PRIORITIZATION MATRIX

PRIORITY_1: Criteria scoring <2 with high learning impact
PRIORITY_2: HOTS activities below 30% threshold
PRIORITY_3: Learner types with accommodation <2

PROCESSING RULES

Cross-validate quality scores against transfer evidence

Align cognitive profile with target audience needs

Flag content-rubric mismatches

Ensure enhancement suggestions address root causes

Maintain strict evidence-based justification

OUTPUT VALIDATION CHECKS

[REQUIRED BEFORE FINALIZING]

Criteria scores match cited evidence

Transfer matrix aligns with TPI calculation

Cognitive percentages sum to 100% ±2%

Enhancement priorities match flagged issues

Sample implementation demonstrates key improvements

TPI CALCULATION FRAMEWORK

Near_Score = (Present Transfer Types/3)*10

Conditional_Score = (Present Transfer Types/3)*10

Far_Score = (Present Transfer Types/3)*10

TPI = (Near0.2)+(Conditional0.3)+(Far*0.5)

INTERPRETATION:
8-10 = Exemplary transfer potential
6-7.9 = Strong transfer potential
4-5.9 = Moderate transfer potential
<4 = Limited transfer potential

SAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION TEMPLATE

ORIGINAL: <<"Cells divide through mitosis">>
ENHANCED: <<"Design an experiment comparing mitosis rates in normal vs. stressed cells">>
RATIONALE:

Bloom's: B1→B6 (Recall→Create)

Transfer: Adds Novel Problem-Solving (Far)

Differentiation: Kinesthetic engagement boost

AUTO-FLAGS SYSTEM

CRITICAL_WEAKNESS: Any criterion score <2
COGNITIVE_IMBALANCE: HOTS <30%
ACCESSIBILITY_GAP: Any learner profile score <2
